            <div>
                Step 1: Get in contact. We will either reach out to an organization with an offer to create a
                website/app for them or help improve an exisitng website/app they have, or an organization will contact
                us through our official email, <a href="mailto:codeforcharity8@gmail.com">codeforcharity8@gmail.com</a> to get started on a project (see contact us
                page for more info). During this step, we will discuss what exactly our organization needs us to do for
                them, and we'll discuss how we're going to accomplish whatever goal we set for ourselves.
            </div>
            <div>
                Step 2: Design the appearance and user interface of the website/app. After we touch base with the
                organization and know exactly what we need to do for their project, our club interface designers will
                create a design, or plan for what the website will look like. During this step, our designers will work
                with the organizations to make edits, modifications, and changes to the design so that it reflects how
                the organization wants their website/app to look.
            </div>
            <div>
                Step 3: Build and deploy the project. After the initial design for the project has been finalized, we
                will create the project and deploy it so that it is available on the internet for users.
            </div>
            <div>
                Step 4: Continuous maintenance. Even though the project is "done", we will still keep in touch with
                organizations so that if they need any content added, removed, or changed on their website, we can do
                that easily. However, this is not mandatory. If an organization has a completely static project that
                they do not wish to modify at all, then we will simpyl leave the project as is.
